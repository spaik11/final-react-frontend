# Final Project
## About
In this final project, I decided to go with a dashboard theme. On the side panel, you will see a Spotify player with the lo-fi hip hop music playlist. We have two main links, the Overwatch page and the Covid-19 stats page.

### Overwatch
On this page, a user that registers with an Overwatch Id will be able to see their player card. If you are logged in, your card will have a black border surrounding it. Please note that the API will only recognize PC players (sorry console).

### Covid-19 Stats

This page will render a chart of the active cases of Covid-19. The user will be able to filter by country.

## Routes & Links
User routes using JWT (JSON Web Token) 

    /login
    /logout
    /register
    /profile
    /getAllUsers


Two main page links to render
